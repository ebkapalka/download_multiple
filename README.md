<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a quick minimum effort tool to download a list of URLs
using the open source tool youtube-dl.  This merely takes a list
of URLs and passes them through the library's own function to
download the video.  The youtube-dl library without modification
already has a function with this feature, however, this little
wrapper script adds some feedback and error handling, including
printing the index and returning a list of failed URLs.  This
is very likely a functionality already built into some function
of the youtube-dl toolset.

This was originally intended to be a demonstration of using
subprocess.popen to call the command line utility, however, 
after moments of Googling I found that a library already
exists that nicely wraps up communication with the tool.

This goes particularily well with a browser addon
such as 
[Copy All Urls](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-all-urls/djdmadneanknadilpjiknlnanaolmbfk?hl=en) 
for Chrome.
